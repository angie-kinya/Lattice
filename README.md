# Lattice
This repository contains a simple data analysis for the Lattice-physics (PWR fuel assembly neutronics simulation results) dataset from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

# Findings and Observations
1. The dataset contains 39 enrichment features and 2 target variables (k-inf and PPPF).
2. There are no missing values in the dataset.
3. The mean k-inf and PPPF vary across enrichment ranges, with higher enrichments generally leading to higher k-inf values.
4. The scatter plot shows a weak positive correlation between k-inf and PPPF.
5. The distribution of k-inf is approximately normal, with most values centered around the mean.
